For updating from 9.xx, to 10.11 or more, some extra work is needed beyond just replacing the .pas files.

Make a decision... do you want to use the BigDecimal library?  Are you going to trade bitcion, or other tiny
fractions of shares?   

  Yes?  then read the bigdecimal.txt file
  No?   then BigDecimal is not needed.

But still you need to adjust your forms, and the event parameters to match the adjusted API declarations, like so:

1/  Copy the new API files over the old.

2/  With the installed TIABSocket API components file (.dpk), Open, uninstall, compile, and reinstall.

3/  In your application modify / replace the 5 (if used - see below) affected event function / procedure headers
      with the BigDecimal versions. This can get messy: try to comment out the event declaration and code from both
      the interface and implementation sections. Save the form, confirm delete unused references. Now create new the
      required event handlers and move your existing code into these.

4/  Adjust your application code for some fields and parameter that went from Integer to Double.


Affected events: TIABSocket API. These are OnTickSize, OnTickPriceAndSize, OnMarketDepth, OnMarketLevel2,
  OnHistogramData, OnProfitLossSingle

You will see a new type of BigDecimal, but without the BigDecimal library, this type is simply a redefinition of
  type Double, and can be treated as Double in your code.
